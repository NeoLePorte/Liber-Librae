# Liber-Librae
FSJS Project

This is a simple CRUD app to catalog books in my collection. I plan to expand it out a bit into a way to share books and give friends recommendations. At the moment it just takes basic book info like Title, Author, ISBN, ect. And stores them on a MLAB database. I used react and semantic ui for the front-end, express for the back-end and redux for state management. I chose to use redux mainly to learn it and become more acquainted with the flux pattern. 

To Run:
clone project |
npm install |
npm run start:dev |
